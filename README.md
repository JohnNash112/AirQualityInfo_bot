# realTimeAQI.py
# Search for real time AQI of the cities in India
``` This is just a small implementation of web data parshing and working with APIs. ```  
The python program in this project retrieve Real time AQI data from ``` https://data.gov.in ```.  
After retrieving the data from the govt. API it loads it and then ask for user to enter a **city** name and as I have used free API it gives limited data at a time 
As this is just a sample I am not using my personal ``` API key ``` and I will update the key once I complete this whole project.
